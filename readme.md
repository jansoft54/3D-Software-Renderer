# 3D Software-Renderer

An attempt to generate 3D objects without a graphics API (e.g. OpenGL / DirectX).


### Prerequisites

To contribute you first have to install the latest version of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and clone the repo
```
 git add remote origin https://github.com/jansoft54/3D-Software-Renderer.git
```
<p>You can also download the latest release which delivers the needed dll's.


### Example
 There may be some distortion due to github image compression

### Features

* 3D rotation based on rotation matrices

* Implementation of a thin abstraction layer  for the camera

* Triangle rasterisation routines (which can be turned of or on the SFML version is faster)

* Flat terrain generation

* Cube generation

### Future Plans
* Implementing a proper Z-buffer

* Maybe texture mapping

* *Obj file loader*




## Built With

* C++ 17
* SFML 2.4.2
